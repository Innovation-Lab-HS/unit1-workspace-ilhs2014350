# Code Challenge - MyProgram-errors

The `MyProgram.java` program contains **three** errors. Correct the errors and
submit a working version of the program.

*The entire `MyProgram` class is given, but you only need to modify the
code in three places to make it compile and output code from the `println`
statements*
